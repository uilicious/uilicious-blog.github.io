Hello World,

This site is brought to you thankfully with the following :

+ https://pages.github.com/
+ http://jekyllbootstrap.com/
+ https://jekyllrb.com/
+ https://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/theme-the-program

And to be honest, it was a pain to setup. And it really echo's [how it feels to learn javascript in 2016 ](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.bbsq9dcub)

But at the end, we now have a pure static blog site, and not a wordpress site.

Fast static hosting makes it worth it.
