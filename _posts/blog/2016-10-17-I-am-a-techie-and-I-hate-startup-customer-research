You see, as a techie. I do not want to be traveling around, talking to people about my startup idea. And this probably echoes the feeling of many tech startup founders. Especially so as they are talking to their investors / accelerator program partners.

- My idea is awesome : Believe me
- I am an introvert (most techies are)
- The problem is obvious, we just need to come up with a good solution
- My parents, siblings, friends, neighbours, and even my cat love my idea.
- “A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them” (as famously said by Steve Jobs)
- I love my product, everyone else will love and pay for it too.

But I still do the early startup research and development, because I (Eugene Cheah) have lost a startup for not doing so.

-------------

You see, my first startup. SocialOctet. Specializing in social media based tools and any real time application, while selling its “revolutionary” javascript backend called JSJ (JSJ: Serverside Javascript - it’s a recursive acronym). 

Think of it as a closed source Node.js before most developers knew it existed, with very very different design philosophy. In fact they're both built using the V8 engine, with the goal of server side javascript. It even had modules before NPM did. And it was a wonderful product with over a year of development in it. With lots of optimization for CDN and caching baked in. And solved many of the real-time concurrency demands that PHP simply could not handle (at that time)

But let me cut the technical features bragging story short, because this is old history : it may have gotten funded, but no one bought it.

Not a single dollar was made across its 1 year + history.

At the end of the 1 year, the company was surviving purely on web and application development, with real-time web application services being served with our custom backend.

Because you see our customers, as much as they talk about it, or even seem excited about it.. Do not really really care…

- If JSJ could handle over a 1000 more concurrent users then their existing PHP on the same specs
- Is compliant with the upcoming HTML5
- Or that I really really loved and believed in my product

What they really care about

- Can my customers do whatever i requested in real time (map search, chat, etc)
- Is my server down? Is my customer complaining?
- Oh and how they were just recovering from the sub-prime crisis.

So despite the fact I manage to get a few production sites up and running. It was still 0 dollars in trying to sell the backend engine. 

Hell the customers I was dealing with would not cared even if i doubled the amount of servers required, and just did everything in PHP.

Slowly and surely the startup pivoted into pure web & mobile application development. Because somehow mobile development that had nothing to do with our backend, became a necessity to staying alive.

And towards the end of it. The founders all could no longer decide nor agree on how they would move on with the company, despite being profitable. Which subsequently led to the company collapse.

This ended with me consolidating all its developers and technologies together left over with another “failed” started (Twin-E tech) alone. Into a Web & Application development company, so as to ensure everyone hired in both startup, still have work for them, and that no one got “fired” from the company collapse. 

Which is now known today as Picoded Pte Ltd.

All this pain would have been avoided if I simply did customer R&D before working on my JSJ backend. And knew better what my customer truly wanted. And perhaps then things would turn out much differently.

So my advice to the techies out there, have a paradigm shift. View early startup customer R&D as…

> “Getting a list of potential customers, that you can quickly sell to once you actually finish your prototype. And get personal feedback on their problems and my product.”

Ignore all the the business school talk, because no amount of it will convince you, as it didn’t for me. It still doesn’t convince me now. 

But just keep telling yourself the above, and you will have effectively “tricked” yourself in doing customer R&D. And save yourself the painful lesson, of having no one to sell your product to when your done.
